```

You will try to establish your own script. 

1. Create a new folder called "Lab5". 

2. Create a subfolder called "data".

3. Download the data from COMPASS, save it under the data folder. 

3. Open RStudio, establish a new project under Lab5. 

4. Go to File---New file---R script. Name it as Lab5_part2.r. Save this script under Lab5 folder. 


Please refer to the slides or the cheatsheet, select a proper function to finish the following tasks. Pipes are highly recommended here for this assignment.

## Part 2: HOUSEHOULD INCOME ANALYSIS USING ACS DATA
Now we will work with the American Community Survey Dataset.See details from https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs 

As suggested from the official website, the U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS) is designed to answer all types of questions and to meet the needs of policymakers, business leaders, planners, and others nationwide who need good data to make informed decisions. 

The dataset includes information from 2013-2017 5-year ACS at county level across entire country.

Below is the preview of dataset. 

Column name  | Description
------------- | -------------
GEOID  | Numeric codes that uniquely identify all administrative/legal and statistical geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data
County  | County Name
State | State Name
hhincome | Median Household income 
medage | Median Age
pop| Population in Total
White | Total population White alone
Black | Total population Black or African American alone
Native | Total population American Indian and Alaska Native alone
Asian | Total population Asian alone

### Load dataset:

Type and execute the script below. 
```{r eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
census_import <- read_csv("data/CENSUS2017_county_raw.csv")

```

This census datasets contains 3220 rows and 16 columns.  

## Question 1: 
Is this data clean? Double check the preview of the ideal table, and use proper functions we have introduced in these two weeks to fix the issues.

Name the new clean data as "census_clean". You should only have 3220 rows and 10 variables (GEOID, County, State, hhincome, medage,pop, White, Black, Native, and Asian).

***Please copy and paste your script into the word document to answer question 1. ***


## Question 2 preps: 
Household income is the combined gross income of all members of a household who are 15 years or older. It is an important economics indicator of a county's standard of living: economists use household income to evaluate the economic health of a given area/county. Let's find out average median  household income (column `hhincome`) for all the records, which gives us the average median household income of the entire country.

Type and execute the script below:
```{r eval=F}
mean(census_clean$hhincome,na.rm=T)
```
## Question 2:
Based on the average value you get in Question 2 preps, ***what percentage of the counties' median household income are higher than the average?***You just need to report the percentage in your answer. 


# Question 3:
***Which state has the highest average median household income? What is the average median household income for that state?***

Hint: you should `group` the data by state, and then `summarise` the average household income for each state. The last step is to rank (using `arrange` function in descending order) the results to find the top record. Pipes are highly recommended here.


# Question 4:
Race data are used in planning and funding government programs that provide funds or services for specific groups. Also, these data are used to evaluate government programs and policies to ensure that they fairly and equitably serve the needs of all racial groups and to monitor compliance with antidiscrimination laws, regulations, and policies. In this dataset, 5 race groups are included.

***Which county has the highest percentage of "Asian" population? Can you explain why (e.g. history of Asian migration)?***  Just type your answers in a few words in the word document. 

Hint: add a new column first to store the precentage of Asian population. Name the new column `pec_asian`. Then rank this column in descending order. 




# Question 5:
***For each state, which county has the largest total population within that state?***

You should return this result as a new table, called max_pop. This max_pop table should only contains these columns: ***GEOID, County, State, and pop***. The table should be ranked by state name in alphabetical order (A-Z). Submit a screenshot as a preview of this max_pop dataset. Just include first 10 rows and 4 columns. 

Hint: you should get 52 rows and 4 columns for this max_pop data. 
To filter out which county has the largest poplation, use `filter(pop==max(pop)`. 

Suggested functions: `group by`, `filter`, `select` and `arrange`. 





You are done with part 2. Submit your answers as a word document in COMPASS.
